Risk factor of bone marrow transplant recovery prognosis

Project objective: identify the prognosis predictor of bone marrow transplant recovery. Examine whether the following characteristics measured at the time of transplantation (baseline) were associated with the risk of a negative outcome (death or relapse): patient age and gender, donor age and gender, patient and donor cytomegalovirus (CMV) immune status, the wait time from diagnosis to transplantation, disease group, French-American- British (FAB) classification based on standard morphological criteria, and prophylactic use of methotrexate to prevent aGVHD.
